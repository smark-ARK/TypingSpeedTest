There is no wind in the football.
I talk, he talk, why you middle talk?
You rotate the ground 4 times.
You go and understand the tree.
I'll give you clap on your cheeks..
Bring your parents and your mother and especially your father.
Close the window airforce is coming.
I have two daughters and both are girls..
Stand in a straight circle..
Don't stand in front of my back
Why Haircut not cut..?
Don't make noise.. principle is rotating in the corridor
Why are you looking at the monkey outside the window when I m here?
You talking bad habit
Give me a red pen of any colour.
Can I have some snow in my cold drink?
Pick the paper and fall into the dustbin.
Both of you stand together separately.
Keep quiet the principal just passed away!...
Don't laugh alone pass it
